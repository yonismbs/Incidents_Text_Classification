He obtained permission to access the electrical room  and then drove behind the school to where the room was located. Employee #1  was onsite to replace the short circuit ratio (SCR) controller system board  and the photo board on a Kohler emergency backup generator. These boards were  within 9 in. of the exposed live current parts. The generator was set up in  Phase 3  power factor 0.8  kilowatts 33  kilovolt-ampere 41  amperes 50 and  factory test and reconnect F. Its model number was 33RZ272 and serial number  was 245558 and was setup in voltage of 277/480. The generator was operating in  normal operating limits with no problems. Employee #1 removed the positive  battery cable on the generator and turned the generator in the off position.  He then removed the front housing on the generator to access the area for  replacing the SCR board and the photo board. Employee #1 used a socket wrench  that was 7.5 in. long with a 2.375 in. deep well six-point socket to remove a  2.125 in. course thread bolt in the generator. As he removed the bolt  the  wrench contacted a live terminal from the rear switch on the generator  which  electrocuted him with approximately 277 volts. The incident occurred between  1:30 p.m.  the time he arrived onsite and 9:00 a.m. on the next day. The  assistant principal was on the kitchen dock  located behind the school  around  5:00 p.m. when he noticed Employee 1's company van still outside the  electrical room  but did not check on him at that time. The next morning  a  coworker called the school and spoke with the assistant principal  telling him  that he had not heard from Employee #1 since early the day before. The  assistant principal told the coworker to hold on while he went to the area  where Employee 1 was working. When he arrived on scene  he noticed Employee #1  slumped over on his knees with a reach still into the generator. At the point   the assistant principal called the school resource officer and school nurse to  the area. The resource officer instructed the assistant principal to have  power to the entire school shut down before removing Employee #1 due to the  concern that he was still energized. Power was shut down and he was removed  and power was restored to the school. From the investigation  blue wires were  found inside a closed electric box located 18 inches away. The blue wires went  outside and then underground to another building to power lights. These blue  wires on the hot side of the emergency lights breaker box created a back feed  to the generator  which would have caused the generator to be hot even if the  switches were in the off position on the generator. Black and white tape was  placed to insure no exposed wires were visible even in the off position.        ",

At approximately 12:50 p.m.   Employee #1 was standing on the last safe step on the front section of the  stepladder finishing the installation. A coworker climbed up the rear section  of the stepladder and held the access door while Employee #1 was fastening the  screws as the final stage of the installation. The coworker had just started  descending the ladder  when the ladder collapsed  throwing both of them to the  floor. Employee #1  who fell approximately 6 feet  sustained a concussion and  suffered a head injury in the form of a bruised brain. He was transferred by  paramedics to San Francisco General Hospital  where he was hospitalized for  two days. The coworker was not injured. The cause of the accident was improper  use of the stepladder. A serious accident-related citation was not issued   because the Division could not establish a substantial probability of death or  serious injury from a 6-foot fall. The employer was issued General citations.   ",

Employee #1 was operating a 9-foot 5-inches wide articulating truck on a  12-foot 4-inch wide berm which ran adjacent to the retention pond. Employee #1  had been with the company about 18 years and was considered by his foreman to  be an experienced heavy equipment operator. At the time of the accident  the  employer was in the process of raising the berm by 6 inches by using the  articulating truck to dump material  which was then bulldozed to level it  and  then a mobile compactor was used to compact it in place. The employer had four  employees on site; three operating the different pieces of equipment and a  foreman. The weather was sunny and clear. The work was being conducted at the  Miami- Dade Water and Sewer Department construction of a new waste water  treatment plant in Homestead  Florida. The 49 075 pound Caterpillar Model 725  articulating truck was travelling on a western direction at the north end of  the retention pond when the edge of the berm gave way and fell into the water.  According to authorities  the retention pond depth ranges from 21 feet at the  edge to 50 to 60 feet at the middle of the pond. Employee #1 could not be  extricated from the articulating truck until July 23  2008 due to it being  stuck and the door could not be opened by rescue divers.

Two coworkers initially entered the tunnel with  a golf cart at approximately 7:45 a.m. to drop off equipment after activating  the ventilation fan from outside. Approximately 8:00 a.m.  they exited the  tunnel to wait for the concrete truck to arrive at the site. Approximately  9:30 a.m.  Employees #1 through #5 entered the tunnel with the concrete load.  Concrete was carried in eight buggy carts pulled by bobcat. Behind them  the  mechanic and Project Superintendent followed on a propane-operated golf cart.  Around 10:00 a.m.  these employees arrived at the work location and found that  the mechanical ventilation fan had been shut down. Several unsuccessful  attempts were made to start the fan. The Project Superintendent and foreman  decided that work would continue  after measuring the natural air flow using a  handheld Mini Thermo-Anemometer by Extech Instrument. At 11:15 a.m.  the  foreman radioed from inside tunnel that employees were experiencing difficulty  breathing  chest pains  and fatigue. The project superintendent sent golf  carts and removed all employees from the tunnel about 12:16 p.m. Employees #1  through #5 were treated for asphyxia and carbon monoxide poisoning at  University Medical Center (UMC) in Las Vegas and St. Rose De Lima in  Henderson. All five employees were treated at UMC with hyper-oxygen therapy.  Reports from the employer confirmed that employees' carboxy-hemoglobin  concentrations ranged between 12 and 32.                                        ",

During a prejob meeting  that occurred at approximately 11:00 a.m. on October 11  2012  a crew attached  plastic poly sheeting under the existing sheeting drooping inside the  building.

Therefore  Employee #2 used his fall arrest system and tied off  on the super structure. He was standing approximately 9 feet above the  walking/working surface  that is  the top of the silo. The equipment they were  removing had one open hole in the top and one open hole in the bottom. It was  a very windy day. Employee #1 used an oxy-acetylene torch to cut the second  bolt. Combustible dust exploded and created a flash fire  which caused  Employee #1 to fall. Employee #1's 6-foot Protecta brand shock absorbing  lanyard partially activated and broke his fall. Coworker #1 called for  emergency services and then helped Employee #1 remove his harness  enter an  aerial lift  and return to the ground. Employee #1 was transported by  emergency response personnel to the nearest hospital and then flown to a  hospital burn unit in Iowa City. He was hospitalized and treated for burns to  his arms  face  head  and neck.                                                 ",

There were four sets of motor  and pump units in the boiler room. Two months prior to this job  Employee #1  had replaced one of these set. On the day of the accident  they were replacing  another motor and pump unit. All the valves were shut and the motor and pump  unit had been removed from the 12 in. hot water pipe when a motor from one of  the other three units automatically restarted. Employee #1 heard a whooshing  sound coming from the open water pipe  and 120 degress F water started to  spray out. Employee #1 attempted to cap off the pipe; Employee #2 went to  notify the hotel engineer and then returned to help Employee #1. The hotel  engineer was checking the valves and tightening some nuts and bolts on the  couplings when Employees #1 and #2 were suddenly sprayed with hot water.  Paramedics responded and both employees were taken to St. Francis Hospital.  Employee #1 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to his abdomen.  Employee #2 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to the back of his  legs. The employer was cited for two general accident-related violations. The  hotel had only one check valve for the 12 in. hot water pipe that served the  entire 42-story building. There were no other intermediate check valves  throughout the piping system. California Code of Regulations T8 3329(d)  states: \"When dismantling or opening closed pressurized or gravity fed  systems  internal pressure shall be relieved or other methods utilized to  prevent sudden release of pressure or spraying of liquid.\" One of the  functions of the check valve would have been to prevent backflow. It was  discovered after the incident that the check valve was not working properly.  As a result  it did not have the capacity to stop the water from flowing back  into the boiler room. The other general accident-related violations are from  T8 GISO section 3314(c) and (g)  which require a lockout/de-energizing of  electrical equipment. Prior to the removal of the motor and pump unit  the  other 3 units were not de-energized to prevent them from building-up water  pressure of a minimum of 20 psi. The boiler was also not shut down to prevent  build-up of water temperature. A hazard control procedure was not developed by  the employer. A reference was also made to T8 3314(i)  which required on-site  lockout procedures to be followed by outside servicing personnel.               ",

The main line ran east/west  with the subject white pole (\"P1/gas  treated\") located at the west side of an intersection  where it received a  \"T-line\" from the north. A guy was provided at mid-pole height opposite the  \"T-line\". The wrecking operation had proceeded from the west to the subject  pole.

Just after the hanger was released  the  pole failed at a point between 18 inches and 24 inches above the guy attaching  point. The \"T-line\" caused the line bearing the weight of the pole to pin  Employee #1 against the bucket and render him unconscious.

The  crane was a boom truck that was being operated in a closed 11-foot lane  the  fast lane  on one of two bridges  the westbound bridge. Employee #1 operated  the crane without the outriggers extended and with only the jacks down. This  was because the single lane closure did not allow sufficient space to extend  the 17-foot outriggers. The crane was being used to remove the temporary work  platform located on the inside of the bridge. The needle beams were being  removed from under the work platform and were being loaded onto a flatbed  truck that was parked behind the crane. Each beam weighed 1 796 pounds and  measured 21 feet in length. Employee #1 lifted four beams with the crane. He  was removing the fifth beam when that beam started swinging. Employee #1 lost  control of the load and the crane. The crane tipped over and the boom landed  on the eastbound bridge. Employee #1 sustained a knee injury. He was  transported to a hospital  where he received treatment for a knee  bruise/abrasion. He then was released. Maryland OSHA's investigation  determined that the crane collapsed between the 50-foot span of the two  bridges  above the creek that ran 60 feet below. At the time of the collapse   the crane's hydraulic boom was extended to 58 feet and the boom angle was 65  feet. The load chart requires that the boom angle be at a maximum of 45 feet  with the boom extended to 58 feet. Therefore  the crane was being operated  outside the safe parameters required by the manufacturer's load charts.  Employee #1 and his two coworkers were exposed to struck-by hazards while  working with the mobile crane.                                                  ",

Employee #1's employer was subcontracted to  Segue Construction  Inc.  the general contractor  to install underground  plumbing and related plumbing trenches. The employer's workers had excavated a  relatively shallow sewer trench  approximately 2 feet 6 inches deep. They then  set the pipe in the trench. Their work progressed toward one end of the site   while another contractor followed behind to excavate a deeper trench and  install in it the electrical utility. Employee #1 was instructed by Coworker  #1  a manager  to drop back to areas where the sewer pipe had been recently  installed and to tape plastic sleeving for corrosion protection to the 4-inch  sanitary sewer riser. Due to the configuration of site utilities  there were  several locations where the sewer and electrical trenches crossed. One of  these locations was Grid Line 8  between Grid Lines M and N  where the  electrical trench had been excavated crosswise to the sewer trench and  approximately 3 feet from the sewer riser. The work was scheduled so that the  excavation activities of the two trades were not physically conflicting.  Employee #1 worked safely within the sewer trench  installing the plastic  sleeving. He then exited the shallow trench to retrieve more tape. He climbed  out of the sewer trench at the corner where it intersected with the deeper  electrical trench. The corner broke off  and Employee #1 fell into the deeper  electrical trench  a fall height of 7 feet. Although Employee #1 climbed out  of the trench on his own  he was gasping for breath. Coworker #2 came over and  evaluated Employee #1. Coworker #1 called for an ambulance after Employee #1  lost consciousness. The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department responded and  transported Employee #1 to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated for  bruising to the neck. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the employer at  approximately 3:00 p.m. on December 3  2013. It also was reported by the  general contractor and the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department. During  Cal/OSHA's subsequent investigation  it was determined that Diablo Plumbing  was a plumbing contractor that performed work on a wide range of both  residential and commercial projects  including related excavation work. The  investigation report concluded that the employer had failed to reevaluate the  trench conditions when the situation changed. The top edges and corners of the  trench were beveled in many places from drying and cracking and/or minor  sloughing. Where the newer  deeper electrical conduit trench was excavated at  right angles to the sewer trench  the drying reentrant corners where the  trenches met constituted a new hazard to Employee #1  who was working in one  of these areas. The employer had failed to train Employee #1 to recognize and  avoid this new hazard. The investigation found that Employee #1 could have  avoided the new hazard if he had walked further away from the deeper  electrical utility trench before exiting the shallower sewer trench.

Employee #1 then turned the Hydraulic Core Drill  Machine back on because  since it was hydraulic operated  it had to be turned  on to see where the oil was leaking. Employee #1 noticed oil leaking from the  hydraulic fittings on the outer parts of the machine.

He had completed work at a tilt-up  panel commercial construction job in Monrovia  CA  and was dismantling the  crane for travel. Previously  he had unmounted a rear counterweight and set it  on a flatbed truck on one side of the site. This was necessary because the  crane had become stuck in the mud that formed after several days of heavy  rain. To remove the counterweight  the crane had been jacked up and plywood  placed under the wheels to free the crane. Employee #1 then moved the crane to  the other side of the site to unload a spreader bar and associated rigging  onto another flatbed. He did not set the outriggers before starting this job.  Employee #1 then tried to \"get a better look\" at the position of the second  flatbed truck  which apparently had pulled up farther than he had anticipated.  He started to swing the crane to the left and also to boom up on the tires  when the crane began to tip. Employee #1 attempted to jump free of the crane  as it was going over and suffered a fractured right arm. He was transported to  Huntington Memorial Hospital for treatment. Employee #1 later stated that he  felt he had been in error because he should have set the outriggers before  starting the task underway at the time of the accident.                         ",

He proceeded to the lake but was unable to find the  Model Number D9H bulldozer or Employee #1. Employee #1 had driven the  Caterpillar bulldozer into the lake  while moving fill material  and he  drowned. The Investigation revealed that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was in  reverse  and the throttle position was at full  as confirmed by underwater  photographs. The transmission had three forward and three reverse gears. For  unknown reasons  Employee #1 had pushed a large amount of fill into the lake   in the center of the fill area  instead of moving in a consistent left to  right pattern. The reason for the left to right pattern was to slowly extend  the line of fill into the lake consistently  so that it could support the  weight of the equipment. It appears that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was on  this central peninsula  which failed under the weight  and caused the  bulldozer and Employee #1 to enter the lake.

The building was undergoing extensive exterior  restoration due to water damage  including removing the masonry facade and  cleaning the rusted steel beam using pneumatic hammers and needle guns. Two  gasoline powered air compressors (Rolair Systems with Honda engines  Model  #8422HK30) had been placed on the third floor roof of the building. Each  compressor had a 1.5-gallon gas tank and a 9-gallon air tank. In addition   each compressor had a 7.5-gallon auxiliary air tank. The compressors were  usually refueled twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  Gasoline was kept in a 5-gallon type-I flammable liquid can equipped with a  plastic funnel. The employer had recently purchased a different brand of  flammable liquid can (Justrite) whose attached funnel was designed so that it  could be bent and take less space during storage/transportation. That feature  made the funnel susceptible to leakage when pouring the liquid. Employee #1  was refueling one of the compressors. The employer's procedure for refueling  the air compressors  as well as other gas powered equipment  was to ensure the  engine was off. According to the employer's subsequent statement  as Employee  #1 refueled the compressor  the gasoline leaked from the two sides of the  attached funnel onto the hot muffler of the compressor and ignited. Coworkers  #1 and #2  who were on the swing stage  suddenly lost air pressure on their  needle guns and saw that the compressors were on fire.

Employee #1 was working from the sloped roof of the porch  which had a pitch  of 4:12. He fell approximately 9 feet to the concrete surface below. Emergency  services were called  and Employee #1 was transported to Providence holy Cross  Medical Center. He was admitted and treated for a fractured hand and a cut to  the forehead. Employee #1 remained hospitalized for six days. The employer  notified Cal/OSHA of the incident at 3:45 p.m. on August 27  2013. During  Cal/OSHA's subsequent investigation  it was determined that Employee #1 had  been working as a painter for T & T Improvements for approximately five  months. At the time of Employee #1's fall  he was working adjacent to  coworkers and the site supervisor. Interviews were conducted with Employee #1   Employee #1's supervisor (partial interview)  and injured coworkers. The  investigation concluded that Employee #1 had not been using or required to use  approved fall protection  and the Primary Employer  Barrett Business Services  Inc.  did not ensure or verify that at the time of Employee #1's fall he was  using or required to use approved fall protection. This violation of CCR Title  8 Section 1670(a) was determined to be the cause of the fall. Cal/OSHA issued  a Serious Accident Related citation to the Secondary Employer  T & T  Improvements  and a General citation to the Primary Employer  Barrett Business  Services (the latter citation due to lack of evidence of employer knowledge)  according to CCR Title 8 Section 1670(a).

The branch manager at Labor Ready told  Employee #1 that there was another job available in Santa Fe Springs   California  assembling a racking system. He would be working that day for  Henricy Construction of California  Inc. This company installed metal  shelving. When Employee #1 arrived at the jobsite  he was teamed with two  other temporary employees from Labor Ready and a permanent employee from  Henricy Construction. They were assigned the task of placing wire shelving  onto racks. They used a scissor lift to do this. The employees did this job  until they took a lunch break at 11:00 a.m. When the employees returned from  lunch  they started installing nuts and bolts on the beams of the racking  system. At approximately 2:30 p.m.  Employee #1 was up in a scissor lift  approximately 18 feet (5.5 meters) above the surface. He climbed out from the  lift to assist other employees in the installation of shelves. While moving  from one section to another  he fell onto a concrete floor. He sustained a  fractured pelvis and the dislocation of his left shoulder. The owner of the  company was in another section of the warehouse when he was informed of the  accident. Paramedics arrived  and Employee #1 was taken to the trauma center  of St. Francis Medical Center in Lynnwood California. He was hospitalized for  25 days  from October 17  2011 to November 11  2011.

Employee # 1  was delivered a load of rock to Bastrop High School baseball complex at Baron  Ballpark  utilizing a 1999 International 4700 dump truck. Employee # 2 loaded  the truck with approximately 5.09 tons of number seven rocks  and Employee #1  proceeded to drive to Baron Ballpark  which was approximately 0.9 to 1.2 miles  away. Employee # 1 backed the dump truck into the desired dump area. Employee  # 1 parked the truck  and from inside the cab  shifted the \"HOIST\" lever into  the \"RAISE\" position in order to raise the dump bed. He then shifted the \"PTO\"  lever into the \"IN\" position in order to put the hydraulic fluid pump in gear.  Employee # 1 exited the cab of the truck and notice that she had not opened  the tailgate prior to raising the dump bed. Employee # 1 then got back into  the cab of the truck and shifted the \"HOIST\" lever to the \"LOWER\" position in  order to try to lower the dump bed so she could remove the chain from the  tailgate release lever and engage the lever. However  the dump bed would not  lower because the load of rocks had all shifted upon raising the dump bed  and  were resting against the tail gate  creating a counter- weight to the  hydraulic system; the imbalance of weight prevented the dump bed from being  able to be lowered. Employee # 1 proceeded to climb up into the dump bed with  a shovel and began shoveling rock out in order to reduce the amount of  counter-weight so the dump bed could be lowered and the tailgate release  engaged; the attempt was unsuccessful. She climbed out of the dump bed and up  onto a set of the rear tires and proceeded to utilize the shovel to try to  reach high enough to undo the tailgate lever chain and engage the tailgate  lever; the attempts were unsuccessful. Finally  Employee # 1 climbed up onto  the portion of the truck frame directly behind the rear of the cab. She was  standing underneath the raised dump bed  facing the rear window of the cab.  From this position  she successfully proceeded to use the shovel to  undo/unlatch the tailgate release chain and engage the tailgate release  lever/switch. Immediately upon engaging the tailgate release lever  the  tailgate opened and released the load of rock  which removed the  counter-weight that was working against the hydraulic system. The dump bed  lowered swiftly onto Employee #1. Employee # 1 was crushed as she was caught  in between the rear of the cab and the dump bed. Employee # 1 died at the  scene.                                                                          ",

Coworker #1 had covered half the  relatively flat roof with a tarp at the end of the previous day  and that half  of the roof was clean and dry when he removed the tarp the morning of November  25  2013. The other half of the roof had not been covered  because they did  not plan to work on it on this day. Employee #1 had just arrived and accessed  the dry portion of the roof by ladder. According to his statement during the  subsequent investigation  he was unaware that half the roof was still wet and  icy  and he did not notice any ice as he walked to the middle section of the  roof. As he stood near the roof's edge  he reached down and picked up a  roofing starter strip. His feet slipped out from under him  possibly due to  his stepping onto an icy area of the roof. He fell off the roof to the dirt  below  a fall height of 11 feet 3 inches. Emergency services were called. The  Humbolt Bay Fire Department responded and transported Employee #1 to St.  Joseph Medical Center  where he was admitted and treated for a spinal  fracture. He required spinal surgery. Employee #1 remained hospitalized for  six days. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the Humbolt Bay Fire  Department. Cal/OSHA initiated its investigation on December 10  2013.          ",

        "text": " On July 21  2010  Employee #1 was a permanent employee working for a concrete  company as the driver of a gunite truck. The company had been contracted to  install a swimming pool and spa in Ft Myers  FL. Employee #1 had delivered  gunite material  a combination of sand and cement mix  to the location. A  four-person team was also at the accident site to spray and shape the gunite  as it was dispensed from the gunite truck. The crew was positioned forty to  sixty feet away from the truck; they last saw the driver heading toward the  truck with a shovel. Although the truck was empty at the time of the accident   the crew's supervisor assumed that the driver was going to the truck to bang  the shovel against the sides of the bin. This act would have loosened any sand  that had become stuck inside on the wall of the bin. It was often done by  drivers  but only from the outside. Minutes later  the supervisor released one  of the crew members to see if the driver needed assistance. The truck was  empty  and no product was being dispensed by the truck. The crew member  arrived at the truck but could not locate the driver. The truck's auger  which  was still in operation at this time  made it difficult to hear. The crew  member remained at the rear of the truck waiting for the driver. It was at  this time that he noticed a piece of clothing being expelled from the auger.  He quickly turned the truck off and immediately notified his supervisor. The  shovel was found on the top edge of the sand bin undamaged. The supervisor  found Employee #1 inside the truck's sand bin  caught in the 9-inch auger  located in the bottom of the bin. The supervisor called emergency medical  services. The driver was alive when he was extracted from the auger  but he  died on the scene while being attended to by emergency responders due to leg  amputations. The mobile gunite truck was a 1989 International industrial truck  which contained two bins. One bin held sand  and the other held cement mix.  The truck had a 9-inch diameter auger  17 feet  7 inches in length  which ran  through the bottom of both bins. The auger transferred sand from the sand bin  to the cement mix bin. The two materials were combined and sent to another  auger  the mixing auger  located at the rear of the truck. The mixing auger  was located outside the truck bins. It extended 9 feet  9 inches in the rear  of the truck. Although there was a ladder located at the rear of the truck   the only time it was used was when the driver visually inspected the load to  ensure that a full load was received when material was being loaded into the  truck. The loading area was located at the employer's establishment in Cape  Coral  FL. The mobile gunite truck had several warning labels posted on the  outside of the truck warning of the dangers of the auger  including serious  injury  amputation  and death. The driver had been employed eight months. He  had received guidelines and training on driver responsibilities on November  20  2009.                                                                       ",

He was working at a construction project  for a new attraction at Universal Studios in Universal City  CA He was  carrying a folded hydraulic trench shore system with attached vertical rails  from one area of the site to a trench elsewhere on the site. The shore was  made of aluminum. It had dimensions of 22 inches (0.56 meters) by 36 inches  (0.91 meters). The design of the trench shore was such that a shear point was  created at two 4-inch (100-millimeter) positions on the 60-inch (1.52-meter)  rails when the shore system was unfolded. Employee #1 placed the shore on  60-inch (1.52-meter) rails on the ground. As he did this  the system slightly  unfolded  pinching the tips of the ring and middle finger of his left hand  between the system rails and the cylinder base. The two fingers were pinched  between a hydraulic cylinder on the shore and a vertical plate. Employee #1's  supervisor was about 100 feet (30.5 meters) away from the site of the injury.  Another coworker was installing pipe about 15 feet (4.6 meters) away from  Employee #1. He saw Employee #1 moving shores  and when he later heard him  yell  he saw that Employee #1 had injured his hand. Employee #1's skin was  traumatically removed to the bone. Employee #1 was transported to Saint Joseph  Medical Center  where the tips of two left fingers were amputated. It was  necessary that the bone be surgically removed to close the injury. At 5:06  p.m. on June 18  2013  the employer notified the Division of the injury. The  injury was reported to the Division as required. The Division began an  investigation at 11:00 a.m. on June 28  2013. This injury was not caused by a  violation of a Title 8 Standard. Employee #1 was trained  the employer had an  operative safety program  and the site was controlled by a general contractor  and a facility owner with active involvement and safety programs.

The other employees noted  that no symptoms were present earlier in the day. Employee #1 indicated to the  employees that he had a pain in his chest and may have had trouble breathing.  At this time  Employee #1 sat down as he was feeling fatigued. The other  employees noticed that he was sweating profusely and offered to call an  ambulance. Employee #1 refused an ambulance and was provided with fluids to  drink. After awhile  he noted that he was feeling better and the crew noted  that his color was better. He was told by his fellow employees to take a break  in the truck with the air conditioning and walked to the company truck where  he rested.

        "text": " At approximately 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday  June 19  2013  Employee #1 was one of  several workers installing a new sewer line for the city of Redwood City  CA.  The line was approximately 400 feet (122 meters) long and six inches (150  millimeters) in diameter. The workers were in the middle of a street. The  sewer pipe line was approximately 4 feet (1.2 meters) underground and ran  diagonally beneath the middle of Oakwood Street. Workers were using the  \"cured-in-place\" technique at this work site. This technique required that a  tube membrane material be inserted from a manhole and through the sewer and  then retrieved through the next manhole. The first step the workers performed  after preparing the materials was inversion; this process pushed the tube  membrane from one end of the sewer line to the other end through the  bombardment of cool water. The workers installed Enviroliners membrane  material securely in place within the sewer line from one manhole to the next  with cool water  flushing it for approximately one hour. Immediately  afterward  they began to flush it with hot water at a temperature of up to 150  degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius) at 5 pounds psi (34.5 kPa). The hot  water reacted with the polyester  vinyl-ester and epoxy resin in the membrane.  Hot water bombardment would take approximately up to three hours for the  chemical composition to react and to harden this membrane into a hard and  durable pipe material in order to maintain a constant wall thickness of a  pipe. It was done to create a durable  continuous  and smooth interior to  promote and improve strength of the 6-inch 150-millimeter) diameter sewer line  pipe. While flushing the membrane with hot water from a steam truck  Employee  #1 was adjusting the temperature controls from a truck that was right beside  the manhole. The narrative did not specify whether the controls were on a  second truck. The connection went from the hot water steam truck hose through  a manifold  using a sleeve connector  to the membrane  and then on to the  sewer line. At approximately 6:00 p.m.  the membrane area near the manifold  and sleeve connector burst open  and a few cups of hot water squirted out and  onto Employee #1  who was standing nearby. He sustained third-degree burns to  his left elbow  forearm  and left lower back. He cried out in pain and fell to  the ground. His foreman  who was nearby  saw what had happened and immediately  turned off the water flow from the steam truck. Employee #1 was taken to a  Kaiser-Permanente facility in Redwood City and then to St. Francis Hospital   where he received treatment for his injuries. Employee #1 was hospitalized  over 24 hours. The employer reported the incident to the Division the next  day. The Division opened an inspection fourteen days later  on July 3  2013.  At the time of this inspection  the foreman and other employees stated that  what had transpired was a typical day on the job except for the membrane's  bursting  which had never happened before. The foreman stated that the  membrane's bursting at low pressure was an anomaly and probably due to a  factory defect. The foreman stated that the membrane burst at its seams   because it was defective. At the time of the inspection  the membrane that had  burst had already been thrown away. No accident-related violation was issued.   ",

They were working northeast  of Baltimore  Maryland  near Kenwood Avenue and the Baltimore Beltway. The  crew had removed a 30-foot high steel camera pole at an interchange and had  secured the pole onboard a Ford National crane truck. Because a portion of the  pole was extending past the end of the truck  a safety vest was tied to the  end of the pole. The crew took the pole to the State Highway Administration  communication repair facility (\"radio yard\") at 5901 Baltimore National Pike   where they arrived around 1:30 p.m. Checking with the State Highway  Administration employees  they were instructed to place the pole next to a  previously placed pole up against the fence on the east side of the yard. The  crew foreman assigned the other two employees to set up the crane truck and to  unload the 30-foot-long steel pole. The pole weighed between 900 and 1 000  pounds. The truck was brought into place  and the straps were removed from the  pole. The crane's hook was unlatched and the pole was attached to the straps  and the crane hook. While this was going on  a State Highway Administration  truck with two employees inside drove into the yard; its driver asked the  crew's foreman a question about the camera that had been removed from the  pole. The foreman was standing at the driver's side of the State Highway  Administration truck with his back to the crane truck  about 25 to 30 feet  away from the crane truck. The crane operator  who was Employee #1  had  lowered the outriggers on the passenger's side of his crane truck  and the  landing pads were in place. The outriggers were lowered on the driver's side  but without the pads. None of the four outriggers was extended at all. The  crane operator raised the crane's boom and then the pole up and off the truck.  The groundman  who was Employee #2  was holding onto the safety vest tied to  the end of the pole to help steady the pole and to guide it to the storage  location. The pole had to travel up and over numerous fiber reels of various  sizes  some of them as high as 6 feet  3 inches. As the pole went over one of  the fiber reels  it contacted the reel  scratching the thumb of the groundman  and drawing blood. He let go of the safety vest  and the pole bounced. He  looked at his finger and started walking around the fiber reels to grab the  safety vest again. As he did  he noticed that the crane truck was tipping  over. He yelled to the operator to get off the truck. The operator jumped from  the bed of the truck  landing on his feet. The foreman and the State Highway  employees ran over to see if Employees #1 and #2 were alright. Employee #1   the crane operator  sustained bruises  contusions  and abrasions on his legs  in the jump from the truck. Employee #2  the groundman  sustained a laceration  on his finger. Neither employee sustained any further injury as a result of  the overturning of the crane truck  and neither was hospitalized.               ",

The employee reacted  by trying to maneuver the vessel away from the surf but was unable to control  the vessel due to the loss of power to both engines. Unable to effectively  maneuver the vessel  the high surf capsized the June T II as it crossed the  breaking surf at the entrance to Hagatna Boat Basin. Upon impact from the  surf  the employee and the passenger were thrown from the vessel into the open  waters adjacent to buoys 1 and 2.

Employee #1  was patching drywall near and on the 14-foot ceiling while standing on a  Werner 10-foot fiberglass step ladder. This extra heavy duty ladder had a  rated working load of 300 pounds. Employee #1 was 5 feet 4 inches tall and  weighed 163 pounds. Employee #1 was holding the patching compound and spatula  while standing on the second step below the topcap of the step ladder. The  ladder tipped to one side  and Employee #1 fell to the ground  a fall height  of 10 feet. Nearby subcontractor workers heard the fall and saw Employee #1  lying on the ground in pain. They phoned a foreman who was at another  location. The foreman came to the restaurant and called for emergency  services. An ambulance arrived  and Employee #1 was transported to San  Francisco General Hospital. He was admitted and treated for compressed neck  vertebrae  a large hematoma on the right upper side of his head  nerve damage   and spinal pain. He remained hospitalized for four days. This event was  reported to Cal/OSHA on either December 21 or December 23  2013  by a relative  of Employee #1. During the subsequent investigation  begun at the job site on  January 10  2014  interviews were conducted with the employer  Employee #1   and Employee #1's relative. It was established that Employee #1 was standing  on the second step below the ladder's topcap  and this step was 7 feet 8  inches above the ground. He was leaning past the ladder side rails while  patching the drywall. His work position contributed to his fall. The  investigation revealed conflicting versions of what happened next and how soon  the ambulance arrived. Initially  the size and height of the step ladder also  were in dispute. According to Employee #1  after he fell he had to wait  approximately 45 minutes for a foreman to arrive from another jobsite. When  the foreman arrived  he removed the fallen ladder and wanted to move Employee  #1 to his (Employee #1's) house before contacting an ambulance. Employee #1   who was still on the ground  was screaming in pain and said not to move or  touch him and to call the ambulance. The foreman finally made the call for  emergency services. In contrast  according to the employer  a foreman employed  by another company  who was doing the employer a favor by opening up the  jobsite while the employer was away in Canada  called him and reported the  fall event to him. The employer then instructed the foreman to go to the  jobsite. According to the employer  who stated he was on the phone with the  foreman the entire time  it took the foreman approximately 10 minutes to  arrive at the job site. When the foreman arrived  the employer told him to  call emergency services. Based on the Cal/OSHA investigation  the employer was  cited a general accident-related violation: T8 CCR '3276(e)(15)(A) requires  employees to work near the middle of the step and not to overreach. Other  standards relating to ladders were violated  and the employer was cited  accordingly. However  the investigation was not able to establish employer  knowledge. At the time of the investigation report  Employee #1 was taking six  different prescribed medications daily  wearing a frontal neck brace to  minimize vertical movement  and walking with a cane. He had experienced three  seizures  each requiring emergency services and transport to the hospital. In  addition  Workers' Compensation documents had not been given to Employee #1   and he had not received wages for the work performed on December 21  2013  the  day of the fall.

Associates  Inc. dba Nibbi Concrete on a multi-story project  located in San Francisco  CA. Employee # 1  Employee # 2 and Employee # 3 were  carpenters and the fourth was the crew carpenter foreman. The crews pour  approximately 330 cubic yards of concrete on the roof deck and near completion  when an area of roof deck dropped about 4-inches over a stairwell. The crew  attempted to lift the section of sinking roof deck by stabilizing the forms  from further movement. The foreman required the crew to work under the load in  attempt to lift the loaded roof deck false work forms. The crew placed a  hydraulic jack over a beam that was supporting their platform  and placed a  shore post between the jack and the sinking false work beam above. As the crew  applied pressure to the jack  the center platform supporting beam overloaded  and broke in half. Employee # 1  Employee # 2 and Employee # 3 fell 15  20 and  30 feet to the steel stairs below. They were buried by false work  shoring and  about 5 yards of wet concrete resulting in serious injuries. The foreman  managed to grab a guardrail and only suffered minor injuries. The San  Francisco Fire Department reported the accident to the San Francisco District  Office of DOSH. The Division's investigation determined that the false work  erected in stairwell number four (4) for the roof deck  was not engineered  correctly and subjected to load exceeding its capacity. In an attempt to  stabilize and lift the overloaded false work  the employer overloaded their  working platform center support beam that broke in two  causing a catastrophic  failure of the platform and the false work above.

The bundles were stacked in sets of  nine forms each  called panels  and were approximately 49-in. high  6-ft long   3-ft wide  and weighed approximately 500 lbs. One bundle of nine forms  which  was at the bottom  was stacked on top of another bundle of nine panels  for a  total height of 98 in. from the top of a flatbed truck to the top edge of the  18th panel. The distance from the pavement to the top of the flatbed truck was  36 in. Employee #1 was rigging up a sling around the top bundle  so a crane  could remove the top bundle from the flatbed truck. Employee #1 was climbing  up the side of the two vertical bundles  which were made of 18 panels stacked  on top of each other. He was stepping on the edge of the panels with his feet  and pulling himself up with his hands on the bands that surrounded the bundled  forms.

Employee #1 fell backwards 6 to 7 ft to the pavement. The edge of one of  the panels from the top vertically stacked bundle fell on Employee #1 causing  a severe laceration of the tendon and ligament  all the way to the bone  above  his right knee.

According to Employee #1 and to witnesses  it  is believed that a lug securing the middle leg in the three-wire assembly  coming into the panel was loose and that this  coupled with repeated wear   caused a gap in the connection  resulting in the arc and flash over.

Employee #1  attempted to reduce the thickness with the saw. He held the lumber with his  left hand and tried to grind or score the 4-inch surface to plane it down.

He was admitted and treated for lacerated nerves  blood  vessels  and tendons of the left hand. He required hospitalization for six  days. Cal/OSHA received a report from the San Francisco Fire Department on  March 16  2013. The employer reported to Cal/OSHA four days later  apparently  not knowing the reporting requirement. Cal/OSHA conducted an investigation on  March 22  2013 at the worksite. The investigation included interviews with  Employee #1 and Coworker #1.

The Program requirement  includes a requirement for the employer to provide and document training for  employees. The employer had no documentation of Employee #1's training. In  addition  the use of the powered circular saw was not appropriate for reducing  the thickness of the wood board. The employer was also cited for not notifying  Cal/OSHA immediately of the work-related injury.

Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital  admitted  and treated for three finger amputations (index  ring  and  pinky fingers) and damage to the tendons of the middle finger of his right  hand. The San Francisco Fire Department reported this incident to Cal/OSHA   which began its investigation August 22  2013. The investigator determined  that Employee #1 had more than 27 years of carpentry experience and was  knowledgeable in the use and hazards of table saws. During the interview   Employee #1 asserted that he had not removed the blade guard (hood assembly).  He did acknowledge that he was not using a push stick  because he did not  think it was necessary.

The  bulldozer operator would normally make three runs (forward and backward)  spreading the pile of dirt by thirds about 30 to 50 feet from the pile. At the  time of the incident the bulldozer operator was filling in a slight hole about  2 inches deep caused by the blade of the dozer dipping on his last backward  run. The hole was only about 20 feet forward of where the operator directed  the dump truck operator to dump the dirt. This made the forward run a lot  shorter than normal. The bulldozer operator made his run forward  however   stopped shorter than normal due to the dirt filling in the hole. The bulldozer  operator would normally put the dozer in reverse on the fly which means as he  is moving forward he would raise the blade  slow down  put it in reverse   start moving backwards  lower the blade  and then look behind him.
